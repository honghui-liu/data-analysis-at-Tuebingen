# About This Website

The X-ray Data Analysis Workshop at Tuebingen website is built from the material in this repository and published as a Jupyter Book. It gathers hands-on tutorials, scripted walkthroughs, and reference material that support weekly training sessions hosted by the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Eberhard Karls University of TÃ¼bingen.

## Explore Online

The public site will be available soon at https://honghui-liu.github.io/data-analysis-at-Tuebingen/. Once live, you can:

- Follow the week-by-week agenda
- Read through the NuSTAR data reduction walkthroughs and accompanying notebooks
- Access installation guides and background reading
- Bookmark upcoming updates as new sessions are added

## Build Locally

If you would like to preview changes or work offline, you can build the site yourself:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-book build .
```

Open `_build/html/index.html` in your browser to browse the rendered content.

## Stay In Touch

The workshop content is maintained by Menglei Zhou, Honghui Liu and Youli Tuo. Please reach out during the weekly sessions or via the institute channels if you have suggestions for new material or spot an issue in the notes.
