# Welcome to the X-ray data analysis workshop at Tuebingen
*By Menglei Zhou and Honghui Liu*

Starting from Nov 2025, an X-ray data analysis workshop was initiated.

## What?

The goal of this workshop is to provide instruction on data reduction and analysis for data from X-ray missions, including NuSTAR, NICER, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, XMM-Newton, Chandra, XRISM. It will also contain lectures about X-ray spectral fitting, timing techniques and polarimetry.

## When & Where?

The workshop will usually be held in the afternoon of **Wednesday from 16:00 to 18:00 at A210**, Sand 1, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany. See the agenda below.

## Agenda

- 12.11.2025: Walkthrough of NICER data analysis + Basic concepts of spectral fitting (Part II)
- 19.11.2025: Timing analysis — from light curves to power spectra
- 26.11.2025: Polarization analysis — handling IXPE data
