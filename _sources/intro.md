# Welcome to the X-ray data analysis workshop at Tuebingen
*By Menglei Zhou and Honghui Liu*

In November 2025, the Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics at Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen launched the X-ray Data Analysis Workshop. The workshop is designed to provide hands-on training in the reduction and analysis of X-ray data from major space missions, while fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange among students and researchers in high-energy astrophysics.

## What?

The goal of this workshop is to provide instruction on data reduction and analysis for data from X-ray missions, including NuSTAR, NICER, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, XMM-Newton, Chandra, XRISM. It will also contain lectures about X-ray spectral fitting, timing techniques and polarimetry. No prior experience is required. The workshop will start from the ground level and is relevant for anyone interested in skills of X-ray data reduction and analysis. 


## When & Where?

The workshop will usually be held **weekly** in the afternoon of **Wednesday from 16:00 to 18:00 at A210**, Sand 1, 72076, Tuebingen, Germany. The agenda is below and will be kept updated.
